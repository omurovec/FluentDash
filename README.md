# This Rainmeter Skin requires some programs in order to work fully!
Those programs are:
1. [Core Temp](https://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/Core-Temp-setup.exe) for getting various CPU informations
2. [MSI Afterburner](http://www.guru3d.com/files-get/msi-afterburner-beta-download,33.html) for getting memory and core clock
3. [RivaTuner Statistics Server](http://www.guru3d.com/files-get/rtss-rivatuner-statistics-server-download,14.html) for displaying the FPS in rainmeter when you play games.
4. [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/download/binaries/ImageMagick-7.0.8-5-Q16-x64-dll.exe) for getting those smooth, blurry equalizer bars in the music player skin.

## Special thanks to:
1. **jsmorley** for creating an awesome tutorial on how to create a weather skin based upon weather.com information. I used and integrated his WXDataTutorial skin for mine as he gladly wrote all the RegExp needed for it and altered everything that I needed to alter. (https://forum.rainmeter.net/viewtopic.php?t=23169)
2. **theAzack9** for creating the insanely awesome FrostedGlass which enabled me to have this nice, blurry background on all the widgets. (https://forum.rainmeter.net/viewtopic.php?t=23106)
3. **/u/attomsk** for posting that one thread on reddit showing, how you created your gpu widget. I had a look at your code to see how you got Afterburner running together with Rainmeter and used your thread to get more information on how to set everything up. (https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainmeter/comments/2rnp1p/my_detailed_cpugpu_status_skin_oc/)
4. **The Rainmeter Documentation** for simply being an awesome and easy to learn and understand documentation of all the functions of Rainmeter! I don't even know what I would have done without it, it is simply great!
